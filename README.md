##### (The name is a combination of Grumbot and keyboard)

## What does Grumby do?
- Grumby randomizes block placement in Minecraft by randomly selecting a slot from the hotbar after each right mouse click.

- Grumby understands that this can be iritating when not wanted, so Grumby can be deactivated at any time by pressing a hotkey. By default pressing the 'CTRL' key and 'G' will deactivate Grumby. Though this is configurable to any key that you may prefer.

- You can tell Grumby what range of keys to press.
For example, you can keep your sword in the hotbar slot 1 and the blocks you would like to place randomly in slots 2-9. This allows you to build with random blocks, then deactivate Grumby with the hotkey, then kill a Creeper, then get right back to random block placing!
